## Capstone Title:
"Facial Recognition and Motion for Home Surveillance: Design and Development using Arduino and Camera"

## Description:
This project aims to design and develop a home surveillance system that leverages facial recognition and motion detection technologies. By using Arduino and a camera, the system will provide real-time monitoring and alerts, enhancing the security of residential properties. The system will detect motion, capture images, and recognize faces, triggering alarms and notifying homeowners of potential intrusions.
